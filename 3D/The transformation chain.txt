The transformation chain is usually written as:

clip
=
Projection
×
View
×
Model
×
vertex
clip=Projection×View×Model×vertex

Here's how each step works:

Model Matrix:

Input: A vertex in model (or object) space.
Output: Transforms the vertex to world space.
Meaning: This matrix positions, scales, and rotates the object within the world.
View Matrix:

Input: A vertex now in world space.
Output: Transforms the vertex to camera (or view) space.
Meaning: This matrix positions and orients the world relative to the camera (effectively placing the camera at the origin).
Projection Matrix:

Input: A vertex in camera space.
Output: Transforms the vertex to clip space.
Meaning: This matrix applies perspective (or orthographic) projection, preparing the vertex for the perspective divide.
So, the world coordinates are produced as the output of the Model transformation. The chain is:

Model Transformation: Model coordinates → World Coordinates
View Transformation: World Coordinates → Camera Coordinates
Projection Transformation: Camera Coordinates → Clip Coordinates
If you combine them, world coordinates are implicit between the Model and View matrices.
